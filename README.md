# Carlo-Python

These projects showcase my Python coding ability. Packages include but are not limited to numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, sklean, and TabPy. Additionally, these notebooks include notes and interpretations throughout that are easy to understand for those with no technical experience. Take a look at the Tornado_Linear and Tornado_GLM for various prediction models and analysis on tornadoes between 2007-2022.
